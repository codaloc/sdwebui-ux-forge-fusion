## Installation and Running
Nothing special, if you have never installed auto1111 webui's or a fork you probably shouldn't be installing this.

## Disclaimer

### I have no idea what I am doing; <br> This highly experimental and prone to breaking, I haven't tested everything and probably won't maintain this repo. Mainly copied files through meld.
